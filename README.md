# Tello SDK Python implementation by Francesco Antoni

This an experimental version, still to be tested.

## Connection to the drone

In order to properly communicate with the drone, the device in which this library is used obviously has to have a Wi-Fi
card. <br><br> The drone creates a Wi-Fi network to which the device has to connect. The name of the network is
TELLO-XXXXXX, where XXXXXX is the last 6 digits of the drone's MAC address.<br><br> The default IP address of the drone
is
`192.168.10.1` and the default port is `8889`. The device has to be connected to the same network as the drone.
The first method to be called after the init of the class is `connect()`, which will establish the connection
with the drone (although no proper connection will be established since the drone accept only one connection at a
time and uses UDP protocol, this is just to open the communication socket).

## Possible commands

Every method in this library corresponds to command given in the SDK documentation.
Here is a list of the possible commands: <br><br>

| Command   | Python method     | Description                                | Possible Responses |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| command   | `connect()`       | entry SDK mode                             | ok <br> error      |
| takeoff   | `takeoff()`       | Tello auto takeoff                         | ok <br> error      |
| land      | `land()`          | Tello auto land                            | ok <br> error      |
| emergency | `emergency()`     | Stop all motors immediately                | ok <br> error      |
| up x      | `up(x: int)`      | Tello fly up (distance in cm range 20-500) | ok <br> error      |
| down x    | `down(x: int)`    | Tello fly down (distance in cm 20-500)     | ok <br> error      |
| left x    | `left(x: int)`    | Tello fly left (distance in cm 20-500)     | ok <br> error      |
| right x   | `right(x: int)`   | Tello fly right (distance in cm 20-500)    | ok <br> error      |
| forward x | `forward(x: int)` | Tello fly forward (distance in cm 20-500)  | ok <br> error      |
| back x    | `back(x: int)`    | Tello fly back (distance in cm 20-500)     | ok <br> error      |
| cw x      | `cw(x: int)`      | Tello rotate clockwise (angle in degrees)  | ok <br> error      |
